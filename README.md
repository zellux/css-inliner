This script merges CSS stylesheets into HTML files, making these rules inline.

## TODO
- Make inline styles flat, that is, merge container styles into its children nodes.
- Deal with shorthand translation, i.e., {padding: 0} should be expanded as {padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px;}
